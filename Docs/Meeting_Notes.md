# Meeting Notes

A log of the dates and topics discussed in the meetings with my project supervisor, Steven Noble.
A log of the completed tasks can be found in the [Development Diary](Development_Diary.md)

## Meeting 1: 21 October 2025

- Discussed where to start on the project.
    - First stage was to choose a game to implement.
    - Examples included: Drafts, Cops and Robbers, Herding Cats, Othello, Chess (simplified), Halma etc.
    - I decided on Capture the Flag.
- Agreed on the first steps to begin the project:
    - Step 1: Set up the game an rules, create a prototype to allow the game to be played using human inputs.
    - Get the computer to play the game (well). Consider how to apply simple heuristics, a game tree, alpha beta pruning, cost functions etc.
- Start preparing project proposal to be submitted in week 6.
- Next meeting: Week 6.

## Meeting 2: 3 November 2025

- Discussed progress so far on the project.
    - I explained the rules that I had implemented, the early implementation and heuristic development so far.
    - It was recommended to refine the rules and to consider the theoretical graph theory aspects that could be analysed.
- Discussed in detail the project proposal report to be submitted this week.
    - Learned about how to form an effective title.
    - Spoke about how formalising the objectives and deliverables, they are can be closely linked.
    - Took advice on planning the project, including mitigting risk by implementing early deliverables and leaving plenty of time for report writing and contingencies which could take time.
    - Considered ethical implications - also attend the lecture on Wednesday 05/11 for further advice.
- Next meeting week 8.
