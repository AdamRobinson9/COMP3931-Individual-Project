## Meeting 1: 21 October 2025

- Discussed where to start on the project.
    - First stage was to choose a game to implement.
    - Examples included: Drafts, Cops and Robbers, Herding Cats, Othello, Chess (simplified), Halma etc.
    - I decided on Capture the Flag.
- Agreed on the first steps to begin the project:
    - Step 1: Set up the game an rules, create a prototype to allow the game to be played using human inputs.
    - Get the computer to play the game (well). Consider how to apply simple heuristics, a game tree, alpha beta pruning, cost functions etc.
- Start preparing project proposal to be submitted in week 6.
